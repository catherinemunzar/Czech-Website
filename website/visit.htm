    <h3 class="w3-wide"><a name="prague"></a>Prague</h3>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>City of a hundred Spires</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Prague is the capital and largest city in Czech Republic and the center of Europe. It sits on the Vltava River and has a population of about 1.3 million people. It has many large and famous landmarks, such as Charles Bridge on Vltava River with a beautiful view of the Prague Castle on a hill behind it. There is also Wenceslas Square with a large Astronomical Clock that has a performance every hour as well as Saint Vitus’ Cathedral inside the castle walls. It consists of many hills, rivers, towers, and church spires.</p>
    <p class ="w3-justify">Prague has a very rich history. It was the capital of Bohemia and the seat of Two Holy Roman Emperors, flourishing during the Gothic and Renaissance periods. Prague also played a significant role in the Protestant Reformation. The first and second Defenestrations of Prague were when Catholic political leaders were thrown out of the town hall’s windows.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">There is so much to see and explore. Some main attractions include Prague Castle, Charles Bridge which is Gothic but has Baroque Statues, Old Town Square with the Prague astronomical clock, the Jewish Quarter, Petřín hill and Vyšehrad. It is a romantic city that is loved by many- in fact, in 2017 Prague was listed as the fifth most visited European city after London, Paris, Rome and Istanbul.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-wide"><a name="brno"></a>Brno</h3>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Little Vienna</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Brno is the second largest city in Czech Republic located in the southeast and is the capital of the Moravian region. Being closer to Vienna than to Prague, it is often called little Vienna. It was historically a German town, but after the German expulsion after WWII virtually all of the Germans left and now it is a Czech University town. Due to its German roots, many residents of Brno use slang derived from the German language.</p>
    <p class ="w3-justify">Despite being a large urban city, it still preserves traditional Moravian folklore, including folk festivals with traditional Moravian costumes. One famous tradition is the large fireworks competition held in June that no one would want to miss.
</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">There are great sights such as Špilberk Castle, which withstood many sieges and went from being a castle, to a fortress, to a prison, and now a museum. It also has the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, which is built on Petrov Hill in the center of town and has Neo-Gothic architecture on the outside but has Baroque on the inside.  Brno also is home of the Abbey of Saint Thomas, which is where Gregor Mendel established the new science of genetics. AIt is a monastery and had a statue of peas in honor of this scientific discovery.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-wide"><a name="karlovyvary"></a>Karlovy Vary</h3>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Spa Town</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Karlovy Vary is a historic Spa Town that many tourists visit for a day when visiting Prague since it’s very close. About 48,000 people live there, and it lies on the confluence of the rivers Ohře and Teplá, which both translate to “warm” in english.</p>
    <p class ="w3-justify">The town consists of 13 large hot springs with about 300 smaller ones that were believed to have healing powers. The town was actually founded by Emperor Charles IV in the 14th century when he went to visit the springs. In the center of town is the Tepla river with tall neo-Baroque and neo-Renaissance buildings on either side.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">When visiting make sure to stop by Mill Colonnade, a walkway flanked by 124 columns on both sides in the center of the old town. Five of the thirteen hot Springs emerge along here. While your here, you need to visit a spa- many spas have treatment courses that last a week or more that are very popular. Czech glass is very famous around the world, and Ludwig Moser, the man who made this craft what it is today, created his glass workshop here. The Moser Museum is the perfect place to visit to see the process of glassmaking and to see a large glass collection.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-wide"><a name="ceskykrumlov"></a>Český Krumlov</h3>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>A Medieval Town</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Český Krumlov is a town in the South Bohemian Region. It survived the bombings of WWII, which has allowed it to be preserved very well. It was once a medieval feudal town that was once the center of an estate owned by noble families involved greatly in Czech Republic’s politics. The town appears almost the same as it did in medieval times, with Renaissance and Baroque facades, vaulted spaces, and medieval-shaped rooftops. The town still has the original layouts of the streets and interiors.</p>
    <p class ="w3-justify">It consists of a castle on a hill standing above the Vltava River with an old square in the center of town with Gothic, Baroque and Renaissance Architecture. The center of town is in a horseshoe bend in the river. The historic Český Krumlov Castle which was founded in the 13th century has been a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. Although there aren’t many museums or specific buildings to visit, this town transports you back into the beauty of the medieval times through its gorgeous architecture and welcoming locals.</p>
