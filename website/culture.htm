    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Ethnic Groups, Language, and Religion</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Although Czech Republic is just a country in Europe, its ethnic groups, language, and especially religious beliefs may come as a surprise.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Within Czech Republic, Czechs make up about 2/3 of the population, and this includes the Moravians who consider themselves a distinct group. There is a Slovak and German minority, as well as a Roma minority. There is a lot of fear and racism shown from Czechs towards the Roma and towards refugees. </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Contrary to popular belief, the official language in Czech Republic is not Russian. It is Czech, which uses the latin alphabet. Many people there speak Slovak, but the two languages are very similar and thus are interchangeable. There is a minority of people that speak Romani, German, or Polish, and much of Czech slang is derived from these languages. Since Czech Republic is considered Eastern Europe, but is very centrally located in Europe, students in school have a diverse set of languages to choose from to study. During Communism, which ended in 1993, students were required to learn Russian instead of more western languages like German, French, or English. Although Communism ended almost thirty years ago, most young adults still choose to study Russian in school alongside English which is now a required language to study. A shift can be seen in Czech Republic now since most students are choosing languages like French or German to study instead of Russian.
</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Many would expect a country in Europe to be very Christian, but Czech Republic is often called one of the most atheist countries in the world. Many believe that this is due to the influence of Communism. During Communism, Atheism was the official policy. People had to attend church anonymously since being a church-goer would cause suspicion and would prevent people from getting promotions or leadership positions. This negatively affected religious views in Czech Republic. In 1989 when religious freedom was granted, 9/10 Czechs identified as atheists. The 1/10 Czechs that are religious tend to identify as Catholic. Czech Republic has many beautiful historical churches. Most are not used, and if they are often they are almost empty. In the Czech republic there is a strong barrier between Catholics and Protestants. A common joke one may hear is that there is a Catholic man who tells his Catholic friend that his daughter became a prostitute. The friend reacts very negatively, telling him that he is so sorry about his daughter. The man is confused, and restates that his daughter is simply just a prostitute and is wondering why his friend is so upset. The friend is relieved and replies that he misheard him and thought that he said protestant instead of prostitute.</p>

    <h4>Svátek</h4>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Name Day</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Every name is assigned a certain day of the year. Many of these names are the names of Catholic Saints and thus their name day aligns with the feast day of the corresponding saint. Every child has a “name day” and on this day the child receives gifts, often more than they would if it was their Birthday. Everyone celebrates their name day, regardless if they are Catholic or not. This is a tradition that is seen celebrated in many cultures. For example, Mexican Catholics celebrate it.</p>
    <h4>Velikonoce</h4>
      <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Easter</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Instead of hunting for eggs, a Czech tradition is for girls to color and decorate eggs while instead boys create wooden whips. Typically, boys go from house to house and chase and whip the girls to receive their eggs and candy. However, in recent years usually male friends visit their female friends and collect their eggs without whipping them.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">The Easter Feast consists of smoked meats, eggs, and nettle. As dessert a cake is served with a cross on top as well as a "beránek," which is a cake in the shape of a lamb.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Everyone cleans their home on Easter, and if they attend church they wear something brand new.</p>
    <h4>Vánoce</h4>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Christmas</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">About a month before Christmas, the annual Christmas markets open in almost every town. People go shopping for their friends and family, often choosing handmade gifts. Families begin baking Christmas cookies, such as vanilla rolls, ginger bread and sweets with nuts, almonds, coconut, raisins and chocolate.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">On December sixth it is Saint Nicholas’s Feast day. On this day the children leave their shoes out and Saint Nicholas comes and fills their shoes up with sweets.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Christmas is celebrated on Christmas Eve. Traditionally families would buy their Christmas tree on the morning of Christmas Eve, but recently families have been buying them the week leading up to Christmas instead. The Christmas tree remains until Three Kings day, which is January sixth. Most Children avoid eating food all day in hopes that they shall see the golden pig, and every year a special Christmas Film is created and families watch it together. In the evening families eat dinner together. The dinner is fish soup, carp, potato salad, and Christmas cookies. Traditionally the family buys and keeps a carp alive until Christmas Eve when they eat it. After dinner the parents prepare the gifts. They ring a bell, signaling that baby Jesus has arrived and left gifts for them. Lastly, all families, whether Christian or not, attend midnight mass.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Lastly, on Christmas day families visit the graves of their loved ones and leave flowers for them.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-wide"><a name="artmusic"></a>Art and Music</h3>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Bohemian Glass, Composers, and Karel Gott</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Although Czech Republic does not have much historical art since communism restricted art, it has found fame in its glassmaking, composers, and beloved singer Karel Gott.</p>
    <p class ="w3-justify">Bohemian glass, also known as Bohemian Crystal, is internationally recognized for its high quality, craftsmanship, and innovative designs. It is hand-cut, blowed, engraved, and decorated to create things such as jewelry, giant chandeliers, wine glasses, and figurines. Bohemia became famous for its glass during the Renaissance when  Bohemian glass-workers found that potash combined with chalk clear glass that was more stable than Italian glass. Czech glassware became highly sought-after and glass chandeliers can be found in the palaces of the French King Louis XV, Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria, and Elizabeth of Russia.</p>
    <p class ="w3-justify">The most influential and famous of the Czech classical composers are Bedřich Smetana, Antonín Dvořák, and Leoš Janáček. Bedřich Smetana (1824-1884) pioneered a Czech musical style that became closely identified with Czech Republic’s independent statehood. Thus, he is considered the father of Czech music. He is internationally known for his operas <em>The Bartered Bride</em> and <em>Má vlast</em> ("My Homeland"), which portrays the history, legends and landscape of the composer's native land. His first nationalistic music was written during the 1848 Prague uprising, in which he briefly participated. After failing to establish his career in Prague, he left for Sweden and established a musical school there. This was where his most famous works were written. Antonín Dvořák (1841-1904) was one of the first Czech composers to be internationally recognized. He won the Austrian prize competition twice and even went to teach in New York. Inspired by Smetana, Dvořák composed nationalist music with aspects of Moravian and Bohemian folk music. He used his operas to convey czech national spirit, which can be seen in all nine of his operas except the first one which have librettos in Czech. He is most famous for his <em>New World Symphony.</em> Janáček (1854-1928) was a composer, musical theorist, folklorist, publicist and teacher. He was inspired by Moravian and other Slavic folk music to create an original, modern musical style which was first seen in his opera <em>Jenůfa,</em> which was often called the Moravian national opera. His first musical works were heavily inspired by Dvořák and Russian composers, but once he started making music that was more inspired by national folk music his music became widely popular. His most famous operas were  <em>Káťa Kabanová</em> and <em>The Cunning Little Vixen</em>, the <em>Sinfonietta</em>, the <em>Glagolitic Mass</em>, the rhapsody <em>Taras Bulba</em>, two string quartets, and other chamber works.</p>
    <p class ="w3-justify">Czech Republic has many famous artists and composers, but there is only one famous singer that stands out. Karel Gott (1939-2019) is considered the most successful singer from Czechoslovakia and Czech Republic. He is known as “the golden voice of Prague” and has won the annual Czech national music award 42 times. He released over 100 albums and sold an estimated 50–100 million records worldwide. He had a lot of success in Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Germany. Many Czech citizens, however, had a strong dislike for him. This is because during the communist era most singers spoke out against communism and were thus unsuccessful thanks to the communist party’s control. Karel Gott, who never outright supported the communist regime, never spoke out against them which allowed him to find success. Nonetheless, he was loved by Czech Republic. When he died on October 1, 2019 the government approved a state funeral and declared the day of the funeral a national day of mourning.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-wide"><a name="influences">Influences</h3>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Behemianism, Music and Dance, and the Protestant Reformation</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Although most people in the United States would not be able to come up with even one influence Czech Republic has had on the Western World, it has had many. Czech Republic has influenced Bohemianism, music and dance, and played a vital role in the Protestant reformation.</p>
    <p class ="w3-justify">Bohemianism is an unconventional lifestyle often focused on artistic and literary pursuits and is associated with wanders, adventurers, and vagabonds. It is a way of life that focuses on an individual and his/her impact on the world and it’s often associated with the hippie counterculture or the Beats in the United States. This “movement” arose in the Bohemian region of Czech Republic when the French called nomadic Czechs this as an insult for being poor and soon they began calling poor French artists this. This idea of a carefree lifestyle arose when many Czech Bohemians gathered in Prague naked to protest.</p>
    <p class ="w3-justify">Just like in any European country, lots of classical music was composed in Czech Republic. Janáček, Dvořák, Smetana, and Martinů were famous Czech composers and people such as Mozart temporarily lived in Czech Republic and wrote many pieces there. Moving from classical music to something a little more modern, the classic circus music originated in Czech Republic. “Entrance of the Gladiators” was composed by the Czech composer Julius Fučík. The Polka, one of the world’s most famous dances, arose in the small town of Týnec nad Labem in 1834. This dance strongly influenced Mexican cultural music. In the 1880s, many Moravian immigrants moved to Texas and many Czech waltzes and the Polka quickly became popular to the Mexican immigrants in that area.</p>
    <p class ="w3-justify">Czech Republic was central to the Protestant Reformation. Jan Hus, a Czech Reformer and University Professor, was one of the forerunners of the Protestant Reformation prior to Martin Luther. He advocated for liturgy in the language of the people (i.e. Czech), having lay people receive both bread and wine as communion, married priests, and eliminating indulgences and the concept of purgatory. He was declared a heretic and burned at the stake at the Council of Constance in 1415. Since the Council did not address these theological tensions, it led to the Great Schism and Hussite Wars which took place in Prague.</p>
