    <h2 class="w3-wide">Cuisine</h2>
    <h3 class="w3-wide"><a name="history"></a>History</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">Due to Czech Republic’s location its cuisine was influenced by various cultures and traditions, such as from Slavic and Celtic tribes.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">In the old times, preparation of food was accompanied by various rituals and incantations were recited. When Germans and Celts dominated Europe, the basis of the diet was raw plant materials, such as cereals and legumes. They also got milk from cows and ate birds.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">In Bohemia and Moravia in the 13th century (Middle Ages) the cuisine greatly varied. It was mainly bread (rich families had white bread), meat with sauce and bone broth, porridge and peas. They added flavor using herbs and spices, honey, and fruit. Their drinks consisted of flavored water using honey or herbs and beer. Their beer was made at home and was heated and drunk. It resembled fortified porridge with a high starch content and according to public opinion, it was necessary that a man knew how to drink.
</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">In the 15th century the first written recipes started appearing. This was during the time of feudalism, which caused great variances between the foods of the rich and poor. The rich showed off wealth with feasts and festivities consisting of a lot of game meat and wine. On the other side of the spectrum, the poor returned to mainly a plant-based diet with porridge and bread and only had meat on holidays.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">In the 18th century colonial crops such as potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, corn peppers laid foundations for Czech National cuisine as we know it today. The food became very energy rich, high in fat and sugar. The main emphasis was on lunch which consisted of thick soup and a second course composed of meat, sauce, and a side dish, or fruit dumplings. This type of meal is what is seen in Czech Republic today.
</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">WWI brought famine, but after the famine, Czechs returned to their cuisine. However, WWII created a rations system on the food and communism caused there to be only cheap, low-quality food that was simply produced for the masses. This created the Czech mentality of quantity over quality. However, after 1990 the food got better again due to food imports from abroad. Although the Czech quality of life has greatly increased, consumers still shop based on what the lowest prices are.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-wide"><a name="dailyeating"></a>Daily Dining</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">The Czech cuisine is very heavy, being made up mostly of meats and starches. They do not eat many vegetables since winters are long and thus vegetables are scarce, however mushrooms are abundant and are used in many things such as soups. A typical Czech dish consists of meat, usually pork, flower dumplings, and sauce. Flour dumplings are unique to Czech Republic and were created to feed peasants when meat was something that they enjoyed only on holidays. Another key feature of Czech food is cabbage. Sauerkraut is commonly served warm as a side dish.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">A typical day of eating as a Czech would consist of a breakfast made up of bread with jams, honey, and butter with tea or coffee. Cold meats such as ham would also be eaten as well as eggs. Lunch is the main meal of the day, unlike in the USA where the main meal is dinner. It begins with soup, then “second food” which is the main course, and then a dessert. A common meal for lunch is open-faced sandwiches, which are common in Czech Republic and are also often served to guests. They usually have some sort of spread with ham, hard-boiled eggs, tomatoes or ketchup, pickles, and cheese. Dinner is usually eaten in the evening and is meat with sauce, such as goulash, as well as a side dish.</p>
