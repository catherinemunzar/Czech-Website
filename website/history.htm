    <h3 class="w3-wide">Bohemia</h3>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>The Birth of Czech Republic</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Present-day Czech Republic was inhabited by the Celts in 4th Century BC which gave it the name Bohemia, but by the 5th and 6th centuries Slavic Czechs dominated the region. Saints Cyril and Methodius introduced Christianity into Bohemia from Moravia in the 9th century, and by the 10th century Bohemia had been Christianized and consolidated by the princes of the ruling Přemyslid dynasty. The Přemyslid rulers were able to attach Moravia to Bohemia and transform them into a viable kingdom.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">The Kingdom of Bohemia reached great wealth in the 13th and 14th centuries under Otakar II who spread Bohemia’s territory to parts of Austria and to the Adriatic Sea. However, when Otakar was killed in an invasion of Austria in 1278, Bohemia was soon once again reduced in size and influence, and the Přemyslid dynasty itself came to an end in 1306. In 1310 the Luxembourg dynasty began its rule in Bohemia. In 1355 Charles of Luxembourg, the king of Bohemia, became Holy Roman emperor as Charles IV. He is remembered for founding the University of Prague (1348) and for greatly increasing the boundaries and importance of Prague, which he made the capital of the empire. The famous Charles Bridge in Prague is named after him.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">The Bohemian Kings began to be associated with the German rulers of the Holy Roman Empire. This caused German Colonization in Bohemia which resulted in greater wealth and the creation of the oldest German University in Prague. However, there were ethnic tensions among the Czechs and Germans. In the early 15th century the Hussite Wars occurred, which was a pre-Reformation movement led by Jan Hus. The Luxembourg Dynasty ended in 1437 and eventually the Habsburg archduke Ferdinand I of Austria laid claim to the throne, thereby establishing Habsburg rule over Bohemia in 1526. Conflicts between Protestants and Roman Catholics culminated in 1618 in a Protestant revolt against the Catholic Habsburgs. Czech nationalism and Protestantism was suppressed, and most of the population gradually converted to Roman Catholicism. </p>

    <p class ="w3-justify">When The Austro Hungarian empire collapsed at the end of WWI the Czech and Slovaks were brought together to create Czechoslovakia, founded by Tomáš G. Masaryk and Edvard Beneš. The large presence of Germans in the Bohemia region created a pretext for nazi Germany to invade Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement in 1938. In 1939 Czechoslovakia was invaded by Adolf Hitler. After the Allies success in World War II, Czechoslovakia was restored in 1945. Czechoslovakia was reconstituted and Germans were expelled out.</p>

    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Soviet Bloc</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Edvard Beneš was the President of Czechoslovakia in 1948 when a communist coup caused the country to be ruled by the Communist party and to be part of the Soviet Bloc. There had been a growing communist party in Czechoslovakia which forced other parties out of the government and forced Beneš to hand over the Cabinet to them. A rigged election was held to validate the Communist victory and Czechoslovakia became a single-party state. This was a virtually bloodless event, since Communism had already virtually spread into all of Eastern Europe.</p>
    <p class ="w3-justify">Under Communism, Czechs faced persecution, were jailed for dissidence, and some were even tortured to death. They were not allowed to travel outside of the country. Those who did not comply with socialism were not only interrogated, intimidated and put under surveillance but also subject to house searches, during which the Secret Police invaded citizens’ privacy while searching for illegal literature. Bribes abounded; the presence of bugs in homes prevented people from speaking openly; there were long lines at the shops; people were imprisoned for filing complaints or signing petitions. Furthermore, the rich turned poor as owners of extravagant housing were given new accommodation in the country. If a citizen defected, the family left behind was severely punished. People socializing with dissidents were interrogated and accused of subversion. Purges were carried out where mainly military leaders, Catholics, Jews, and democratic politicians were put on unfair trials and were executed. The government controlled everything. Students weren’t accepted into University if they didn’t show support for communism, people lost jobs who didn’t follow guidelines given by the regime, and people were murdered or imprisoned for even attending church.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">The Prague Spring was mass protests and political liberalization by the Czechs from January 5th, 1968 to August 21st, 1968. The president, Alexander Dubček, gave the Czechs additional rights such as looser restrictions on media, travel, and speech. However, this attempt to humanize communism failed when the Soviet Union invaded in August 1968 and suppressed those reforms.</p>

    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Communist Regime Collapses</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">The Communist regime collapsed in 1989 due to the Velvet Revolution. This was due to human rights activism that started on January 1, 1977 when over 250 human rights activists signed a manifesto called the Charter 77, which criticized the government for failing to implement human rights provisions of documents it had signed. On November 17, 1989, the communist police violently broke up a peaceful pro-democracy demonstration and brutally beat many student participants. In the days that followed, Charter 77 and other groups united to become the Civic Forum, an umbrella group championing bureaucratic reform and civil liberties. Its leader was the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel. Faced with an overwhelming popular repudiation, the Communist Party collapsed and Havel was elected President of Czechoslovakia on December 29. It was a non-violent transition of power that occurred from November 17 to December 29, 1989. The first free elections in Czechoslovakia since 1946 took place in June 1990 without incident and with more than 95% of the population voting.</p>
    <p class ="w3-justify">By 1992, Slovak calls for greater autonomy effectively blocked the daily functioning of the federal government. On January 1, 1993 Czech Republic peacefully divided into two independent states, the Czech and Slovak Republics. Czech Republic joined NATO, the EU, and the OECD.</p>
